**Overview:**
The Spaceship Game is an engaging mini-game built using Three.js, designed to showcase the capabilities of the TON blockchain. It offers players a thrilling gaming experience while integrating decentralized blockchain technology to reward their in-game achievements with tokens and NFTs.

**Concept:**
The game centers around a daring escape mission where players pilot a spaceship fleeing from a hostile base. The path is fraught with danger, represented by "pink cubes" that players must avoid. The farther the spaceship travels, the more intense the challenges become, requiring quick reflexes and strategic maneuvering.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

1. **Objective:**
   - The primary goal is to guide the spaceship safely through an obstacle-filled path while avoiding collisions with pink cubes.
   - Each successfully navigated level takes the spaceship further from the base, increasing the difficulty as the journey progresses.

2. **Controls:**
   - The spaceship is controlled using simple arrow keys or touch gestures, enabling players to move left, or right.
   - Players must rely on their reflexes to dodge moving and stationary pink cubes.

3. **Game Features:**
   - **TON Blockchain Integration:** 
     - Players earn blockchain-based rewards, such as tokens or collectible NFTs, for achievements like clearing levels, achieving high scores, or setting records.
     - Rewards are stored securely on the TON blockchain and can be traded or showcased on compatible platforms.

4. **Reward System:**
   - In-game tokens and NFTs are awarded based on performance, milestones, or special challenges.
   - Collectibles earned in the game are unique and serve as a digital proof of accomplishment.

5. **Immersive Experience:**
   - Dynamic lighting and sound effects enhance the gameplay, creating an immersive space escape journey.
   - The game features an adaptive difficulty curve, with increasingly complex cube patterns and faster speeds as players progress.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Three.js Rendering:** The game leverages Three.js for creating vibrant 3D graphics, ensuring smooth and visually captivating gameplay.
- **Blockchain Features:** TON smart contracts handle the minting, storage, and transfer of in-game assets, ensuring secure and transparent interactions.
- **Easy Onboarding:** A seamless connection to the TON blockchain allows even novice players to access the game and manage their rewards with minimal friction.
